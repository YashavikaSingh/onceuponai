The New Atheism,Victor J. Stenger,"In recent years a number of bestselling books have forcefully argued that belief in God can no longer be defended on rational or empirical grounds, and that the scientific worldview has rendered obsolete the traditional beliefs held by Christianity, Judaism, and Islam. The authors of these books—Richard Dawkins, Daniel Dennett, Sam Harris, Christopher Hitchens, and Victor J. Stenger—have come to be known as the ""New Atheists."" Predictably, their works have been controversial and attracted a good deal of critical reaction. In this new book, Victor J. Stenger, whose God: The Failed Hypothesis...",9781615923441,,The New Atheism_1.jpg
Brain Wars,Mario Beauregard,"These profound questions have provoked considerable debate throughout history and have over several centuries led cultures to develop beliefs about human nature, immortality and the afterlife. Scientists working under the presumption that matter is all that exists have concluded that consciousness can be seen as simply a collection of nerve cells in the brain. That is, there is no separation between consciousness or the mind--who we are--and the function of brain. Dr. Beauregard disagrees. He asserts that multiple lines of hard evidence reveal that consciousness is transmitted and filtered ...",1443407062,,Brain Wars_2.jpg
Jonathan Swift and Philosophy,Janelle Pötzsch,"Jonathan Swift and Philosophy is the first book to analyse and interpret Swift’s writing from a philosophical angle.

At the heart of all human experience lies our obsession with death.
